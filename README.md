# ecommerce-project-dbms

This repository contains all the materials used in the making of the E-commerce DBMS-SQL project assigned to us during our elective course INFO3132(Distributed DBMS). 

## Updates Required

1. @Everyone check, i have designed the schema(all the tables and their relationships) in [schema.sql](https://github.com/therupdeep/ecommerce-project-dbms/blob/main/schema.sql).
2. Everyone check [ERD.md](https://github.com/therupdeep/ecommerce-project-dbms/blob/main/ERD.md) and @Susnato design accordingly.
3. @Susnato implement the cardinality changes described in cardinality.md
~~4. Remove the online shopping site entity from the ERD diagram as we cannot make the Online Shopping site table with no attributes. Also remove its relationships with other tables.~~
